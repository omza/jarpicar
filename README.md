>[j]ust [a]nother [r]aspberry [pi] [car] - Experimental - Wifi controlled RC Car

Since 2016, I'm thrilled with the endless possibilities that a RaspberryPi offers ... so the soldering fumes pulled into our house. By a lucky coincidence, my son just broke his RC car at that time. Instead of repairing the car, I decided to build a tablet-controlled car with video transmission. The jarpicar was born:

*1 x broken RC car
*1 x RaspberyPi Model 3
*1 x RaspiCam
*1 x L298n Motor Driver
*2 x UltraSonic Sensor HC-SR04
*a lot of frustration but high fives

With Python & Flask Framework I have written a web app that runs on the RasPi and which can be accessed with any tablet via Wifi. This was the beginning of my personal Python story!
